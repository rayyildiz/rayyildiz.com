I started this blog with the motto "Knowledge becomes more beautiful when shared," and sharing what I know has helped me learn even more. Shortly after my first encounter with DOS, I was introduced to Linux, which became a significant turning point in my life. This experience was one of the main reasons I chose to pursue computer engineering as my career.

As a software engineer, I work with languages like Golang, Rust, Java, and Python, as well as cloud native and serverless technologies. I created this website to bring together technical articles I've published on various platforms along with new content I write.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to write for a long time, and this blog has become somewhat of an archive. However, I chose to keep it around for posterity. As an excuse, I'd say the rise of microblog-style social networks has had an impact—so let me point you to my [Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/rayyildiz.com) (I'm closing my Twitter account).

In an era where the internet is increasingly filled with misinformation, I strive to produce accurate and valuable content. Feel free to reach out to me with any corrections, suggestions, or feedback.

Thank you in advance.
