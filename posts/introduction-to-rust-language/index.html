Rust is an open-source systems programming language known for its focus on safety and
performance. Developed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, it was first released
in 2015.
Rust offers memory safety without using a garbage collector, making it a valuable tool in system-level development where
efficiency is critical.

Safety: Rust&rsquo;s biggest selling point is its emphasis on memory safety. It achieves this through a system of
ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. This system prevents common bugs and ensures
thread safety."><meta name=keywords content="blog,developer,personal"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://rayyildiz.com/avatars/rayyildiz.jpg"><meta name=twitter:title content="Introduction to Rust Programming Language"><meta name=twitter:description content=" What is Rust?

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p><strong>Safety:</strong> Rust&rsquo;s biggest selling point is its emphasis on memory safety. It achieves this through a system of
ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. This system prevents common bugs and ensures
thread safety.</p><p><strong>Performance:</strong> Rust provides performance similar to C and C++. It does this while offering higher safety guarantees,
particularly around memory management.</p><p><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Rust makes it easier to write code that is free from data races. Its ownership model naturally guides
developers to write safe concurrent code.</p><p><strong>Zero-Cost Abstractions:</strong> The language is designed to provide abstractions without overhead. This means you can write
high-level abstractions, but the compiler will optimize it to be as fast as handwritten lower-level code.</p><p><strong>Tooling:</strong> Rust comes with Cargo, a command-line tool that helps manage projects. Cargo handles building code,
downloading
libraries, and more.</p><p><strong>Community and Ecosystem:</strong> Rust has a vibrant, welcoming community, and its ecosystem is growing rapidly. The language
has an extensive collection of libraries, known as &ldquo;crates,&rdquo; available through the Cargo package manager.</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-rust>Getting Started with Rust

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>To start with Rust, you need to install the Rust toolchain. The easiest way to do this is
through <a href=https://rustup.rs class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>rustup</a>, a command-line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.</p><p>Once installed, you can create a new project using Cargo:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-Shell data-lang=Shell><span style=display:flex><span>cargo new todo_app
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>cd</span> todo_app
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This creates a new directory with a simple &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo; program. You can run this program with:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-Shell data-lang=Shell><span style=display:flex><span>cargo run

<a class=heading-link href=#learning-resources><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Rust has excellent documentation,
including <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Steve-Klabnik/dp/1593278284 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>&ldquo;The Rust Programming Language&rdquo;</a>
book, which is available online for free. Additionally, there are
many <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>tutorials</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@RustVideos class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>videos</a>, and community
forums where new <a href=https://rust-for-rustaceans.com class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Rustaceans</a> can seek help.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion
<a class=heading-link href=#conclusion><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Rust is a modern programming language that offers a rare combination of safety, speed, and concurrency. It&rsquo;s an
excellent choice for <code>system-level</code> and <code>application development</code>, especially in scenarios where <em>performance</em> and
<em>reliability</em> are crucial. With its growing community and ecosystem, Rust is well-positioned to become a leading
language in the software development world.</p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned developer or just starting, Rust offers a unique and rewarding programming experience.</p></div><footer><section class=see-also></section></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
