On one side, advocates argue that async enhances performance and scalability, especially in I/O-bound and high-concurrency applications. On the other side, critics point to its complexity and potential for complicating the codebase. To fully understand this debate, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to examine the differences between asynchronous programming and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Communicating Sequential Processes&lt;/a> (CSP) model, particularly as implemented through channels in Rust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Android Uses Rust for Enhanced Memory Safety</title><link>https://rayyildiz.com/posts/android-uses-rust-for-memory-safety/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rayyildiz.com/posts/android-uses-rust-for-memory-safety/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://developer.android.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android&lt;/a>, the widely used mobile operating system developed by Google,
has &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently&lt;/a> started incorporating the Rust
programming language to enhance its memory safety. This move signifies a major shift in Android&amp;rsquo;s approach to
system-level programming, primarily dominated by C and C++.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Traditionally, Android&amp;rsquo;s core system components have been written in C/C++, known for their performance and control
over system resources. However, these languages come with significant &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenges&lt;/a>, particularly in memory safety. They
lack modern safety features, leading to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences. Such issues
have been the root cause of many security vulnerabilities in Android.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Rust Programming Language</title><link>https://rayyildiz.com/posts/introduction-to-rust-language/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rayyildiz.com/posts/introduction-to-rust-language/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-rust">
 What is Rust?

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust&lt;/a> is an open-source systems programming language known for its focus on safety and
performance. Developed by &lt;a href="https://github.com/graydon" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graydon Hoare&lt;/a> at Mozilla Research, it was first released
in &lt;a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015&lt;/a>.
Rust offers memory safety without using a garbage collector, making it a valuable tool in system-level development where
efficiency is critical.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Safety:&lt;/strong> Rust&amp;rsquo;s biggest selling point is its emphasis on memory safety. It achieves this through a system of
ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. This system prevents common bugs and ensures
thread safety.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rust vs. Go: Exploring the Differences</title><link>https://rayyildiz.com/posts/rust-vs-go/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rayyildiz.com/posts/rust-vs-go/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">

&lt;p>In the vast landscape of programming languages, &lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://go.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go&lt;/a> stand out as two compelling choices for developers seeking modern solutions to their software development needs. Both languages have gained significant traction and popularity in recent years, each with its unique set of features, strengths, and use cases. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into the differences between &lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://go.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go&lt;/a>, highlighting their key characteristics, use cases, and trade-offs, helping developers make informed decisions when choosing the right language for their projects.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
